print("Hello World")
# This 'Hello World' is called a string i.e. a sequence of characters.
# In simple words, it means some textual data.
# While writing code in any language, we always write string in quotes.
# In python, we can use single or double quotes.
# print is a built-in function in python.
# It is used to print any message on the terminal window.
# Terminal window shows the output of the code.

# Variables:
# They are used to temporarily store data in the computer's memory.
# e.g: We can store someone's name, email, age or the price of a product.

age = 20
# This means we are storing the number 20 somewhere in our computer's memory and label that memory location as age.
# Now, we can read the value of this variable at its memory location and print it.

print(age)
# Here, we will not write the word age in quotes because we do not want to display the string 'age'.
# Instead, we want the value of the variable age.

# We can also change the value of this variable.
age = 30
print(age)

# So, we can see that our program gets executed from top to bottom.

price = 19.95
# We can use whole number or decimal in python.

# first_name = "Sansita"
# To separate two words in a variable name, we should use underscore. It makes our code more readable.

# Boolean Value: It a data type which can take any of the two values - True or False
is_online = False

# Python is a case-sensitive language i.e. it is sensitive to lower case and upper case.
# So if we write 'false' here then we get error because it is not a valid value.
# False is a keyword in python which represents boolean false value.

# Exercise 1
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"
age = 20
new_patient = True
